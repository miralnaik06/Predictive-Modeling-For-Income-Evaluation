# Predictive-Modeling-For-Income-Evaluation

Overview of the problem Statement: 
- We have information about people's income in different countries. Our goal is to use this information to build a model that can predict if someone earns more than 50k dollars or not. 
- By doing this, we want to figure out what factors are important for having a higher income. Understanding these factors can help us learn about the reasons some people make more money than others. This information is useful for people who make decisions about policies (rules or plans), researchers who study society, and anyone curious about what makes people financially successful in different parts of the world.
- This project has the potential to give us insights into how things like where you live, your job, and other factors might affect how much money you make. These insights can be valuable for making informed decisions about policies and understanding the reasons behind financial success in different places and for different groups of people.

Objective:
- To predict the income of the Census by uncovering Socio-Economic Dynamics and People Characteristics.
- Itâ€™s a classification Problem
